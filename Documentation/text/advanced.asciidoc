[[pushsupport]]
== Push Component Support
Tigase Messenger for iOS supports link:https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html[XEP-0357 Push Notifications] which will receive notifications even when accounts are logged off.
Devices must be registered for push notifications and must register them VIA the Tigase XMPP Push Component.
This can be done using an ad-hoc command sent to the hosting component.  Tigase push component has a specific ad-hoc command known as `register-device` for this purpose.

Deregistration of a device may be accomplished by a similar ad-hoc command, using the `unregister-device` command on the Tigase push component.

For more information on the push component and its' capabilities, visit link:http://docs.tigase.org/tigase-push/snapshot/Tigase_Push_Notifications_Guide/html/[push component documentation].
